Guys I have no idea what I'm doing here so if you have any suggestions lmk -Liam

Rules:

1) Only commit/push the card you worked on so that way you don't roll back changes on another card
2) leave helpful commit messages
3) you don't need to follow the naming scheme because I'm pretty sure we can just see the date the latest change was
4) Put cool silkscreen on your boards
